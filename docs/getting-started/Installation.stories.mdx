# Installation

Multiple [NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/orbit-ui/packages) compose Orbit. By creating a bundle package named [@sharegate/orbit-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sharegate/orbit-ui), we simplify the installation process and allow you to install Orbit with just a single package.

> We assume that you have already set up [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom). Otherwise, you'll get a warning at installation.

## Install packages

To install Orbit, open a terminal at the root of your project workspace and run the following command:

<PackageInstallationSnippet packageName="bundle" />

The command will install all Orbit packages in the `node_modules` folder of your application.

## Import styles

Orbit styles include the ShareGate font, a [CSS bootstrap](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-orbit/tree/master/packages/css/src) and of course the component's styles.

To import Orbit styles add the following import declaration to your root stylesheet:

```css
/* index.css */

@import "~@sharegate/orbit-ui/index.css";
```

## Configure your application

Below is an example of how to configure an application with a [pre-constructed ShareGate theme object](?path=/story/theming--page#option-3-retrieve-a-pre-constructed-theme-from-orbit):

```jsx
// index.ts

import { createThemeVars, ShareGateTheme, ThemeProvider } from "@sharegate/orbit-ui";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

createThemeVars([ShareGateTheme]);

render(
    <ThemeProvider theme={ShareGateTheme} colorScheme="light">
        <App />
    </ThemeProvider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Instead of harcoding the foundation values in Orbit, we choose to implement a [theming system](?path=/docs/theming--page) allowing applications to supply their core values to Orbit.

The theming system introduced a concept of theme object. To configure Orbit, you'll need to build your own theme object or import a pre-constructed one from Orbit. The theme object will be used to create the foundation variables with the `createThemeVars` function and define a [theme provider](?path=/docs/theme-provider--default-story) at the root of your application.

## Start creating components

You're all set! You can start creating your application with Orbit:

```jsx
import { Div, Text } from "@sharegate/orbit-ui";

export const App = () => (
  <Div backgroundColor="alias-warning">
    <Text color="alias-primary">Hello World!</Text>
  </Div>
);
```
